## Usecase 04- Safeguard your agents with AI Red Teaming Agent in Microsoft Foundry

**Scenario**

Zava is a fast-growing technology and services company that manages
large volumes of internal documentation, product manuals, training
material, and customer-support knowledge. Employees frequently need
quick, accurate responses without manually searching through dozens of
files and knowledge repositories.

To improve efficiency, Zava wants to deploy an intelligent AI-powered
assistant that can read, understand, and retrieve answers from its
internal documents. The company chooses Azure AI Agent Service to build
an interactive chat interface, where employees can simply ask a question
and receive a precise, citation-supported answer grounded in Zava’s
internal knowledge.

response. The input and the Azure monitor are able to use the Azure
resources deployed in the solution: Application Insights, Microsoft
Foundry Project, Foundry Tools, Storage account, Azure Container App,
and Log Analytics Workspace.](./media/image1.png)

**Introduction**

As organizations adopt AI agents to automate workflows, answer
questions, and retrieve internal knowledge, ensuring these systems
behave safely and reliably becomes critical. Zava, a fast-growing
technology company, is deploying an internal AI knowledge assistant to
help employees quickly retrieve information from documents, manuals, and
training materials. To protect this AI agent against harmful behavior,
security gaps, or unintended responses, Zava leverages Microsoft
Foundry’s AI Red Teaming capabilities.  
This use case demonstrates how to build a secure end-to-end AI agent,
evaluate its behavior, detect risks through automated red teaming, and
monitor its performance using Azure’s observability tools. Through
guided steps, you will deploy the agent, test its retrieval
capabilities, run red teaming evaluations, and enforce continuous
monitoring to ensure safety, accuracy, and compliance.

**Objectives**

- Understand how to build a document-aware AI knowledge assistant using
  Azure AI Agent Service.

- Deploy Azure resources and configure the full solution using Azure
  Developer CLI.

- Interact with the AI agent using predefined and custom prompts to
  validate retrieval accuracy.

- Execute built-in evaluators to measure agent quality, safety, intent
  resolution, and tool-call correctness.

- Run automated AI Red Teaming tests to identify vulnerabilities,
  harmful behaviors, or safety violations.

- Analyze red teaming results in Microsoft Foundry, including attack
  strategies and failure cases.

- Enable tracing, monitoring, and continuous evaluation to track
  real-time agent behavior in production.

- Learn best practices for securing AI agents through consistent
  testing, observability, and model governance.

Or if you want to navigate from the Azure portal main page, select your
resource group from the 'Recent' list, or by clicking the 'Resource
groups' and searching your resource group there.

After accessing your resource group in Azure portal, choose your
container app from the list of resources. Then open 'Monitoring' and
'Log Stream'. Choose the 'Application' radio button to view application
logs. You can choose between real-time and historical using the
corresponding radio buttons. Note that it may take some time for the
historical view to be updated with the latest logs.

## Task 12: Agent traces and Monitor

You can view both the server-side and client-side traces, cost and
evaluation data in Microsoft Foundry.

![Monitor Dashboard](./media/image86.png)

## Task 13: Continuous Evaluation

Continuous evaluation is an automated monitoring capability that
continuously assesses your agent's quality, performance, and safety as
it handles real user interactions in production.

During container startup, continuous evaluation is enabled by default
and pre-configured with a sample evaluator set to evaluate up to 5 agent
responses per hour. Continuous evaluation does not generate test
inputs—instead, it evaluates real user conversations as they occur. This
means evaluation runs are triggered only when actual users interact with
your agent, and if there are no user interactions, there will be no
evaluation entries.

To customize continuous evaluation from the Azure AI Foundry:

1.  Select **Monitor.** Choose the agent you want to enable continuous
    evaluation for from the agent list and click on **Settings**

> ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

**Summary**

In this use case, you built and secured an AI agent capable of
retrieving information from Zava’s internal documents using Azure AI
Agent Service. After deploying the environment and verifying key
resources—including Container Apps, Azure Cosmos DB, Storage, Search,
and Foundry—you interacted with the agent to test its ability to answer
operational and product-related queries. You then performed automated
evaluations using Microsoft Foundry’s assessment tools and executed
comprehensive AI Red Teaming scans to uncover potential risks. Finally,
you enabled tracing, logging, and continuous evaluation to monitor
real-world usage and ongoing model safety.  
This end-to-end workflow equips Zava with a reliable, secure, and
scalable AI assistant that provides accurate information while meeting
enterprise-grade safety and governance standards.
